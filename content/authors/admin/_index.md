      Responsibilities include:
      - Independently implemented assigned projects that required the application of mathematical and statistical theory for the Decennial Directorate’s (ADDC) Decennial Statistical Studies Division’s (DSSD) Sampling Branch.
      - Engaged in research and development of the methodology for the 2030 Post-Enumeration Survey (PES). Incorporated administrative records and other Census data products to enhance and refine population estimates.
      - Conducted research under the Continuous Count Study project which was built on the <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/program-management/evaluate-docs/EAE-2020-admin-records-experiment.pdf">2020 Administrative Record Census Simulation</a>. Worked to improve and redesign population estimates for intercensal years and also evaluated Census coverage methods. Utilized various modeling methods such as Log-Linear modeling or Latent-Class modeling to produce estimates and imputations. Select preliminary findings will be presented at the <a href="https://ww3.aievolution.com/JSMAnnual2024/Events/viewEv?ev=2792">2024 Joint Statistical Meetings</a>.
      - Provided statistical programming support for the <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/coverage-measurement/pes/national-census-coverage-estimates-by-demographic-characteristics.pdf">2020 Post-Enumeration Survey (PES)</a>.  Performed feature selection and developed imputation models for the probability of being either an Inmover or Nonmover for the components of coverage estimation of the 2020 Census.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
